Welcome to the open repository for ioStudio Modules and ioStudio Designer!

This GitHub repository contains [Configuration](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration) and [Schematics](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Schematics) files for Maritime Autonomous Suface Ships (MASS)

The files in the Schematics folder can be opened and edited using the application [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

The files in the Configuration folder can be browsed and used with the application [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The C++ files in the [Programs](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration/Projects/MASS/Programs) folder can be built using [C++ extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp) for VS Code. The project files in the [Build](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration/Projects/MASS/Build) folder builds libraries for the C++ files in the Programs folder for different platforms. To be able to build the C++ files, another library is required called 'ioSystem'. This can be received by contacting [ioStudioTech](https://www.iostudiotech.com/contact).

The C++ files in the Programs folder cannot be edited manually. They are generated by an ioStudio application loading and saving the XML files in the [System](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration/Projects/MASS/System) folder.

The front-end applications operating the system is configured in the [Applications](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration/Projects/MASS/Applications) folder.
- [Shapes](../Configuration/Shapes/Shapes.md) that are used in the applications are in the [Shapes](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration/Shapes) folder
- [Icons](../Configuration/Icons/Icons.md) that are used in the applications are in the  [Icons](https://github.com/open-mar/iostudio-modules/tree/main/Configuration/Icons) folder

These files are used by ioStudio Designer. The styles, shapes and icons used in the applications are developed by the [OpenBridge](https://www.openbridge.no/) project.
